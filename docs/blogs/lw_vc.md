# 维特根斯坦与维也纳学派趣事

整理自某位老师的lecture中，很有趣（？）：

 The Logical empiricist of the Vienna Circle Rudolf Carnap, Kurt Gödel and a number of others were inspired by Wittgenstein's work.
 They thought he was one of them.
 They saw his work as a logical empiricist work, and Russell did too.
 Wittgenstein hated Russell's introduction to the Tractatus, to thought he had got it completely wrong.
 
 The Vienna Circle invited Wittgenstein to speak before them.
 He came up before the group they expected him to give a paper on logical analysis and the nature of the world and language and thought and so on.
 
 Instead he turned his back to them,
 
and read a poetry.

Now they were mystified by this, it just added to his reputation as a crazy person.


But actually I think it related to the point of "What we cannot speak about we must pass over in silence."
There's certain things he's maintained that can be shown but cannot be said,
and so the point of reading poetry before the group is to say:

Look, I'm not saying that all that other stuff is nonsense,
I'm saying that actually the most important things in life we can't really articulate,
We can't even ask the question that led to a love purpose answer,
but that doesn't mean it isn't important that doesn't mean it isn't there.

So we have to show it, art can do that, music can do that, poetry can do that...

But he didn't think ordinary language could do that.

以及GPT的翻译：

维也纳学派的逻辑经验主义者鲁道夫·卡尔纳普、库尔特·哥德尔和其他几位，都深受维特根斯坦作品的启发。
他们觉得维特根斯坦简直就是自己人。
他们认为他的著作完美符合逻辑经验主义的范式，连罗素也是这么认为的。
然而，维特根斯坦讨厌罗素在《逻辑哲学论》中的序言，觉得罗素完全误解了他。
维也纳学派还邀请维特根斯坦来给他们做演讲。
他们满怀期待，认为他会就逻辑分析、世界的本质、语言与思想等内容发表一篇深奥的论文。
结果，维特根斯坦来了。
他转过身去，背对着所有人，
然后朗诵了一首诗。
大家一脸懵逼，彻底看不懂了，这波操作只让他“怪人”的名声更加响亮。
但实际上，我觉得这与他那句名言有关：
“对于不可说的事情，我们必须保持沉默。”
他始终认为，有些东西可以展示，但无法用语言表达。
所以，他在大家面前朗诵诗歌，似乎是想传递这样的信息：
“我不是说那些东西毫无意义，
我只是想说，其实人生中最重要的事情，是我们根本无法清晰表达的，
甚至连引发这些问题的问题都问不出来。
但这并不意味着它们不重要，也不意味着它们不存在。”
所以我们需要去“展示”它——艺术可以做到，音乐可以做到，诗歌可以做到……
但普通语言无法做到，维特根斯坦对此深信不疑。
